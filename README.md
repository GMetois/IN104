# CMaze

Here's our repository dedicated to the IN104 course at ENSTA Paris.

We aim here to implement QLearning algorithm in order to exit a maze first, then improve it with SARSA or DOUBLE Q algorithm for more efficiency.

Then, we will try to adapt our algorith in order to create a tic-tac-toe bot.

You'll find here several folders :

/Include is for the headers

/Input is for the inputs (pretty self-explainatory, isn't it?)

/output is for the outputs of the algorithm if there's any.

/src is for the algorithms and the environnements by themselves.

There's 2 src : due to time constraints, we couldn't properly work on a clear distinction between environnement files and algorithms and factorize our code. We created a second src for the tic-tac-toe where some files may be slightly different from the maze counterpart.
